  <h3> Description </h3>
  <p>
    the topics of EECE4005 can be divided into two separate but related sections. The first section covers web applications where students will learn the intricacies of front-end development and what goes into building the UI of a web app. Back-end development will also be covered where students will learn the supporting systems behind a web application through its interactions with databases and other behind-the-scene logic. The second section of the course goes over hacking and the security aspect of developing a web application. By adopting the mindset of a hacker and analyzing a web application's vulnerabilities, student's will be able to gain insight on how to minimize and protect their application from common attacks.
